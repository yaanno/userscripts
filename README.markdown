# My User Scripts

## Komment Killer

Bacially it is an antisocial Greasemonkey script for Mozilla users. It's purpose is to hide comments on any web page.

### Motivation

Why the hell I want to hide the comments? Sometimes comments make me crazy so that I leave the page immediately regardless to the quality of the editorial or blog post. To put it plain I want a normalized workflow for reading a document (for myself only of course):

* Read the title
* Read the content
* Think

A few additional steps may occur:

* Read the comments (optional)
* Think
* Read other sources
* Think
* React (optional)

Now I can take away the optional parts easily.

## More Stuff to Come ;)
